Movement of Objects
-----
**Intro:**  *userControlMovement.html* is a demo of a object moving along a sin curve.This demo implemented with a **GUI** so that users can do some controls on the movement of a object. ([view this demo)](https://yiic.github.io/my-three.js-projects/objectMovement/userControlMovement.html))

The movement of the object is implemented by updating object positions in the render function. 

```js
    if(box.position.x < endpoint){
         
        box.position.x += updateSpeed;//speed
        box.position.y = (Math.sin(box.position.x/waveLength)*curveAmplitude);

    }else {

        box.position.x = startpoint;
        box.position.y = (Math.sin(box.position.x/waveLength)*curveAmplitude);
    }

```

**Intro:**  *objectMoveAlongPath.html* is a demo of a object moving along a curve path. The object is random selected from box, sphere, dodecahedron, and cylinder. Reload the page to change the type of object. The path is generated by points with modifiable coordinates.The oject moves **tangently** along the path.
